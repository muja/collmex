### Datatypes

While collmex sends and receives only strings via csv, we treat the data as ruby object.

#### Collmex String
Its represented as a string in ruby. There is no length restriction. So you have to care for yourself that collmex can handle all the contents of a Char field.

#### Collmex Float
Collmex floats are represented as floats in ruby too. You can give it a string or a integer too. When we send something to collmex in a float field, it is limited to 2 decimals.

#### Collmex Currency
Collmex has Currency as its own datatype. In ruby we use the smallest unit (cent in â‚¬) and take the amount as an integer. We have put some special parsing methods when a string should represent the alue of a currency field. Jus take a look at the spec/lib/collmex/api_spec.rb to see how we handle it.

#### Collmex Integer
Integers are the simples datatype and transparent between ruby and collmex. There is just some special handling that cares for delimiters in numbers to represent the correct value
